2. Tailwind CSS was integrated for rapid, utility-first styling.
3. The `PersonalWebpage` component was created as the main content of the site.
4. State management is handled using React's `useState` hook for the active project tab.
5. Project data is organized in a nested object structure for easy management and display.
6. Environment variables are used to store sensitive information like email addresses.
7. The lucide-react library is used for adding iconography to enhance the user interface.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any necessary environment variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_EMAIL=your-email@example.com`)
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Customization

To customize this portfolio:

1. Update the project data in the `projects` object within `PersonalWebpage.js`
